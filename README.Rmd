# Wagedown <img src="man/figures/wagedown_hex.png" align="right" width=200 />

Wagedown aims to provide the Rmarkdown template for PhD candidate in Wageningen University, the Netherlands.

This project was inspired by the [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) package and [thesisdown](http://thesisdown.rbind.io/).

Currently, the PDF and gitbook versions are fully-functional.

If you are new to working with `bookdown`/`rmarkdown`, please read over the documentation available in the `gitbook` template at <https://ismayc.github.io/thesisdown_book>.
